>If there’ll be one future lesson from Slack, it’ll be that it’s not only possible to lose your lead from competitors advancing, but by regressing yourself.

I think this is both true and generally good to keep in mind when running a product which competes with others.

Sometimes you succeed by just being a viable alternative when an incumbent shuts down, declines or otherwise becomes unattractive. [Workplace is shutting down](https://www.facebook.com/help/1167689491269151/) and ceding its place to Zoom's competing product. When Yahoo! bought `del.icio.us`, people fleeing the popular service's new owners turned Pinboard into a much more successful business. Various bad press for Dropbox created opportunities for the small Dropbox competitor I once worked at, etc.
