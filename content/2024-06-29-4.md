> We have tested and tasted too much, lover-  
> Through a chink too wide there comes in no wonder.  
> But here in the Advent-darkened room  
> Where the dry black bread and the sugarless tea  
> Of penance will charm back the luxury  
> Of a child's soul, we'll return to Doom  
> The knowledge we stole but could not use.
