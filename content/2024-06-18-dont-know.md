> If you ever read an article on a subject with which you have a lot of first-hand experience, you'll notice that they always get major things wrong -- basic facts, dates, names of people and organizations, the stated intentions of involved parties, the reasons a thing is happening -- things even a novice in the space would know better about.

> It makes perfect sense, if you think about it, that reporting is so reliably unreliable. Why do we expect reporters to learn about a suddenly newsworthy situation, gather information about it under deadline, then confidently explain the subject to the rest of the nation after having known about it for all of a week? People form their entire worldviews out of this stuff.
