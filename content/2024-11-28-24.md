> However, there are plenty of places where you are socialized into a profession through menial labor. Consider the legal profession. The work that young lawyers do is junk labor. It is dreadfully boring and doesn’t require a law degree. Moreover, a lot of it is automate-able in ways that would reduce the need for young lawyers. But what does it do to the legal field to not have that training? What do new training pipelines look like? We may be fine with deskilling junior lawyers now, but how do we generate future legal professionals who do the work that machines can’t do?

I got to live through "servers are rare and multi-purposed" (pets) to "servers are common and single-purpose" to "servers are easily replaceable and probably virtual" (cattle) -- and it forced me into learning debugging and recovery skills that aren't commonly needed any more. But they're not _never_ needed. It's just that when you need those outdated Unix skills the people who have them are the 40+ year olds or people who came up through under-resourced companies (or countries, even).

I think AI will rapidly increase this cycle but it's interesting to also think about how it encourages the atrophy of existing skills as we outsource the rote and easy parts of our jobs.
