> Tinkering can be therapeutic, and there is nothing wrong with playing on a piece of old kit for a few hours while reminiscing about that first computer or handheld received as a birthday present. Retrocomputing can be an interesting hobby. It does not mean everything was better in bygone days.

I love this. One of the things vilmibm shared about ~town is that it's not retrocomputing. It's about the future and the present, not just reliving the past.

It can be easy to _think_ that it's about the past, to the degree some of us fetishize the "old" ways of doing things. But often those old ways are ... current ways, that fewer people use. Using a CLI. Editing HTML instead of Markdown or using a GUI. Those things aren't "old" in the way that formatting a floppy disk is old.
