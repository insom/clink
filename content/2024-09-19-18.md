> Maybe it’s ok to have multiple homes. I already knew before writing this that home isn’t defined by a location, or the time spent there. Home can mean different things to different people, and that’s perfectly okay.

I like it when an author goes to write one thing and ends up in a different place, but it's still coherent.

I used to rankle at the idea of Ireland as "home" -- that being such an ex-pat stereotype. I never had (and still never have) intentions of moving back there, so it felt silly to call it home. Even if it's where I grew up and have some family. I have family in England and Canada too, and I raised them in those places. Ottawa feels like home, for now.

But then I went back to Dublin last year and that felt like a kind of home, too. Although after my second trip it also felt like I was saying good bye to it.
