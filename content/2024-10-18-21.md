> Customization is the equivalent of a coat of paint or rearranging the furniture; it’s certainly not poking holes in walls and running new wiring.

> Low Road tools aren’t just customizable. They are also extensible. To borrow from Dan Hill, their “seams” are purposefully exposed.

> Extensibility implies the ability to change a software’s capabilities in amount, but not necessarily in kind. An extensible software architecture typically provides an API surface upon which extensions may be built. Such API surface carefully limits the scope of what can and cannot be done.
