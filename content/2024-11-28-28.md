> Bluesky may follow the same path that destroyed Twitter, and we may have this very same conversation fifteen years from now, but that's a pretty good run. You adopt a pet accepting that someday it will die. Don't focus on how it ends. Make the most of the time you have.

This is a good post about Twitter and what comes next but I also wanted to pull out this quote which encapsulates how I've been thinking (or trying to think) lately. Literally nothing is forever and a lot of unhappiness can come from trying to create the perfect thing that will never fail but that's just not how things work.

Even if something were to last your whole life, that's so far from forever that it's not funny. From hobbies to homes to relationships not that many things last your whole life -- you can be sad about that, or you can recognise it as true and enjoy things while they are enjoyable and reminisce about them when they are gone.
