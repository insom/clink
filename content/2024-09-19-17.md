> If you are hiring “professional fakers” that means you are a poor manager. One of the most important thing that leaders focus on is hiring the right people, and that takes experience, or training, or both. Founders tend to lack all of these things, so of course they don’t always hire great people. [...] As Allison Morrow puts it, founder mode is just another way of telling toxic bosses they are really great. And lord knows, that is not what Silicon Valley needs right now.

Ian Betteridge with not just an anti-`pg` post but a bit of sadness about how tech is not as exciting (unless you want to get rich) as it used to feel.
